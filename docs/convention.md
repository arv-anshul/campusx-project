# Conventions of the project

### What is this and why?

This includes the conventions **created and followed by me** during this project. This helps me to write better code and also helps to organize my code in a structure.

## Project Structure Convention

### Notebooks

1. Separate the notebooks of yours and CampusX's sir.
2. Try to create separate folders for every type because it helps to organize the **different versions of the notebook type**.
3. Naming of notebooks: `version_type.ipynb` **`->>`** `1.0_PREPROCESSING.ipynb`
4. **Differentiate between your original notebooks and Sir's modified notebooks.**
